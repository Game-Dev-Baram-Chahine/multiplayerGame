# Multiplayer games using Photon Fusion

  
## Changes Made for the Homework

* Implemented a shield mechanic that allows only one player at a time to acquire a shield, which lasts for a duration of 3 seconds. After the duration expires, a new shield is automatically generated for other players to acquire.

* Added a scoring system specifically for player shooting abilities, specifically when shooting a player.
